This is the repository for Nested and GMM ComBat from the manuscript entitled "Generalized ComBat Harmonization Methods for Radiomic Features with Multi-modal Distributions and Multiple Batch Effects" by Horng et al., published at Nature Scientific Reports (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-08412-9).

# Nested ComBat
This file can be imported to use the Nested ComBat function to harmonize by multiple imaging parameters. See file comments for more details.

# GMM ComBat
This file can be imported to use the GMM ComBat function to harmonize by an unknown parameter inferred from the feature distribution to better handle bimodal distributions. See file comments for more details. 

# Updates
These methods are still a work in progress! Keep an eye out for future updates to the methods.
